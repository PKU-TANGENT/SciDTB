We present CoSimRank , a graph-theoretic similarity measure 
that is efficient 
because it can compute a single node similarity 
without having to compute the similarities of the entire graph . <S>
We present equivalent formalizations 
that show CoSimRank's close relationship to Personalized PageRank and SimRank 
and also show 
how we can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms 
to compute CoSimRank . <S>
Another advantage of CoSimRank is that it can be flexibly extended from basic node-node similarity to several other graph-theoretic similarity measures . <S>
In an experimental evaluation on the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction , CoSimRank is faster or more accurate than previous approaches . <S>
