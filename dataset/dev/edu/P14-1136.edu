We present a novel technique for semantic frame identification 
using distributed representations of predicates and their syntactic context ; 
this technique leverages automatic syntactic parses and a generic set of word embeddings . <S>
Given labeled data 
annotated with frame-semantic parses , 
we learn a model 
that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context around a predicate to a low dimensional representation . <S>
The latter is used for semantic frame identification ; 
with a standard argument identification method 
inspired by prior work , 
we achieve state-of-the-art results on FrameNet-style frame-semantic analysis . <S>
Additionally , we report strong results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling 
in comparison to prior work . <S>
