Recent work on Chinese analysis has led to large-scale annotations of the internal structures of words , 
enabling character-level analysis of Chinese syntactic structures . <S>
In this paper , we investigate the problem of character-level Chinese dependency parsing , 
building dependency trees over characters . <S>
Character-level information can benefit downstream applications 
by offering flexible granularities for word segmentation 
while improving word-level dependency parsing accuracies . <S>
We present novel adaptations of two major shift-reduce dependency parsing algorithms to character-level parsing . <S>
Experimental results on the Chinese Treebank demonstrate improved performances over word-based parsing methods . <S>
