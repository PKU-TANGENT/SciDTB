Earnings call summarizes the financial performance of a company , 
and it is an important indicator of the future financial risks of the company . <S>
We quantitatively study how earnings calls are correlated with the financial risks , with a special focus on the financial crisis of 2009 . <S>
In particular , we perform a text regression task : 
given the transcript of an earnings call , 
we predict the volatility of stock prices from the week 
after the call is made . <S>
We propose the use of copula : 
a powerful statistical framework 
that separately models the uniform marginals and their complex multivariate stochastic dependencies , 
while not requiring any prior assumptions on the distributions of the covariate and the dependent variable . <S>
By performing probability integral transform , 
our approach moves beyond the standard count-based bag-of-words models in NLP , 
and improves previous work on text regression 
by incorporating the correlation among local features in the form of semiparametric Gaussian copula . <S>
In experiments , we show 
that our model significantly outperforms strong linear and non-linear discriminative baselines on three datasets under various settings . <S>
