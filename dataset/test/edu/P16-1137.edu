We enrich a curated resource of commonsense knowledge 
by formulating the problem as one of knowledge base completion ( KBC ) . <S>
Most work in KBC focuses on knowledge bases like Freebase 
that relate entities 
drawn from a fixed set . <S>
However , the tuples in ConceptNet ( Speer and Havasi , 2012 ) define relations between an unbounded set of phrases . <S>
We develop neural network models 
for scoring tuples on arbitrary phrases 
and evaluate them by their ability 
to distinguish true held-out tuples from false ones . <S>
We find strong performance from a bilinear model 
using a simple additive architecture to model phrases . <S>
We manually evaluate our trained model 's ability 
to assign quality scores to novel tuples , 
finding 
that it can propose tuples at the same quality level as medium confidence tuples from ConceptNet . <S>
